# Privacy Policy for Cownapper

_Last updated: 14 November 2025_

This Privacy Policy describes how **Cownapper** ("the Game") developed by **Ezequiel Barreto** ("we", "us", or "our") handles your information.

By downloading or using Cownapper, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.

---

## 1. Information We Collect

Cownapper itself does **not** require you to create an account or provide personal data directly inside the app.

However, the following types of information may be collected through the platforms and services we use:

### 1.1 Device & Usage Data (via App Stores and SDKs)

When you use the Game, certain information may be collected automatically by your device or third-party services, such as:

- Device type and operating system
- Country or region
- App version and language
- Crash logs and performance data
- Anonymous gameplay statistics (e.g., levels played, session length)

This information is generally used in an aggregated and anonymized form and does not directly identify you.

### 1.2 Advertising & Analytics (If Enabled)

If we integrate advertising or analytics SDKs (such as **Unity Ads**, **Unity Analytics**, or similar providers), they may collect data such as:

- Device identifiers (e.g., IDFA, GAID)  
- General location (country/region)  
- In-game events (e.g., level completions, sessions, clicks)

These providers use this data to:

- Show relevant ads  
- Measure performance of ads and campaigns  
- Understand how players use the Game  

Please refer to their own privacy policies for more details.

>If in the future we remove ads or analytics, these SDKs may no longer be active.

## 2. How We Use the Information

We use the information collected for purposes such as:

- Improving gameplay and user experience  
- Fixing bugs and performance issues  
- Understanding how the Game is used  
- (If ads are enabled) Serving and optimizing ads  

We do **not** sell your personal data.

---

## 3. Third-Party Services

Cownapper may use third-party services that collect information used to identify you in a limited way (for example, through advertising identifiers).

These may include, but are not limited to:

- **Apple App Store** and **Google Play Store**  
- **Unity** services (Unity Ads, Unity Analytics)  
- Other SDKs that may be added in the future

Each third-party service has its own privacy policy. We recommend that you review them.

## 4. Data Retention

We do not store any personal data directly on our own servers.

Data collected through third-party services (such as analytics or ads) is retained according to the policies of those providers. Retention periods may vary based on their settings and legal requirements.

---

## 5. Children’s Privacy

Cownapper is intended for a general audience and is **not specifically targeted at children under 13** (or under the minimum age required in your country).  

If you are a parent or guardian and believe that your child has provided personal information via the Game or related services, please contact us at **ezequielbrrt@gmail.com** so we can assist you.
