### 2.2 I lost my progress

At the moment, Cownapper may not support cloud saves or account-based progress (depending on the version you are using).

If you changed or reset your device, your progress might be lost. We are exploring options to improve this in future updates.

### 2.3 I see ads too often (if ads are enabled)

If Cownapper includes ads, we try to balance them so they are not too intrusive. If you feel the frequency is too high, please contact us with feedback—we use this to improve the experience.

On some platforms, you may also have the option to remove ads via in-app purchases in future versions (if implemented).
